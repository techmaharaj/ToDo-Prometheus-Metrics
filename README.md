# ToDo Prometheus Metrics

This is a simple ToDo application built using Python & Flask. It makes use of the official [Promethues Python SDK](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) to add custom metrics to the app.
These metrics are added to `/metrics` endpoint which can be exported to apps like Grafana, New Relic etc. for visualization.
